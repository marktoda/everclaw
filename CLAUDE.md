# CLAUDE.md - everclaw

AI personal assistant built on the Absurd durable task queue. Communicates via pluggable messaging channels (Telegram by default), reasons with Claude (Anthropic), and extends itself through markdown skill files and tool scripts.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm install                              # install dependencies
pnpm test                                 # run tests (vitest --run)
npx tsc --noEmit                          # type-check (no build step)
node src/index.ts                             # run the app
docker compose up --build                 # run with Postgres via Docker
```

There is no build step. TypeScript runs directly via `node` (Node 22.18+ strips types natively). The `pnpm build` script (`tsc --noEmit`) exists but is only used for type-checking CI; the app never uses `dist/`.

## Key Patterns

**Channel abstraction.** Messaging channels implement the `ChannelAdapter` interface (`start`, `sendMessage`, `stop`). A `ChannelRegistry` routes outbound messages by parsing the prefix from `recipientId` strings (e.g. `telegram:601870898`). Each adapter owns message splitting via the generic `splitMessage` utility. Adding a new channel means writing a single adapter file.

**Pluggable channels.** Channels are auto-detected from `*_BOT_TOKEN` secrets in `.env` (e.g. `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` → telegram adapter). The adapter factory in `channels/adapters.ts` maps type strings to constructors. Adding a new channel means writing an adapter file and adding one line to the factory map.

**Voice transcription.** When `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set, the Telegram adapter transcribes voice messages via OpenAI Whisper and delivers them as `[Voice: transcript]`. The shared `transcription.ts` module can be used by any adapter. Without the key, voice messages are silently ignored.

**Stateless message handling.** Every inbound message spawns a fresh `handle-message` task. There is no "wait for reply" — the agent saves state via `set_state`, completes, and picks up context on the next message from conversation history.

**Durable workflows.** The agent has orchestration tools (`sleep_for`, `sleep_until`, `wait_for_event`, `emit_event`, `spawn_task`, `cancel_task`, `list_tasks`) that suspend and resume durably through Absurd. Suspending tools must NOT be wrapped in `ctx.step()` — they throw `SuspendTask` which must propagate to the Absurd worker.

**Path containment.** `resolvePath` in `agent/tools/files.ts` validates that all file tool paths resolve within allowed directories: four built-in (`data/notes/`, `skills/`, `scripts/`, `servers/`) plus any user-configured extra directories. Paths that escape are rejected.

**Extra directories.** Users can mount additional directories via the `EXTRA_DIRS` env var (`name:mode:path` comma-separated, e.g. `vaults:ro:/mnt/vaults`). Each gets read-only or read-write access through the same file tools, with the same path containment and symlink protection as built-in dirs. No side-effects (no schedule sync, chmod, etc.).

**Config: secrets vs env.** Secrets (`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`) are read from `.env` file only and never set in `process.env`. Non-secret config (`DATABASE_URL`, `QUEUE_NAME`, `CLAUDE_MODEL`, etc.) comes from `process.env` with defaults. Channel tokens are stored in `config.channels[]`. Queue name is validated as a safe SQL identifier at load time.

**Chat ID allowlist.** `ALLOWED_CHAT_IDS` in `.env` (comma-separated, fully prefixed IDs like `telegram:601870898`) restricts which users can interact with the agent. When unset/empty the bot runs in **discovery mode** — it replies with the sender's chat ID and setup instructions instead of running the agent. When set, unauthorized messages are silently ignored (logged at warn). Filtering happens in `index.ts` before any task is spawned.

**Skill schedule sync.** Writing or deleting a skill file in `skills/` triggers `syncSchedules`, which reconciles YAML frontmatter `schedule` fields with Absurd's schedule registry. Schedules are prefixed `skill:`.

**Tool scripts.** Files written to `scripts/` are auto-`chmod +x`. Scripts receive JSON on stdin and return output on stdout, with a configurable timeout (default 30s).

**MCP server integration.** MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers are configured via JSON files in `servers/`, one per server. On startup, `McpManager` spawns each server as a stdio child process, discovers its tools via `tools/list`, and exposes them through the ToolRegistry with `mcp_<server>_<tool>` namespacing. Secrets from `TOOL_*` env vars are passed to server processes. Changes to `servers/` trigger automatic MCP reload (new tools are available on the next message). The agent can discover new MCP servers via `search_servers`, which queries the official MCP registry at `registry.modelcontextprotocol.io`. The agent must ask the user for approval before writing any server config.

**Agent scratchpad.** The agent can use `<internal>...</internal>` tags for reasoning that gets stripped before sending to the user (see `output.ts`).

## Tools (18 built-in + dynamic MCP tools)

| Category | Tools |
|---|---|
| Files (5) | `read_file`, `write_file`, `glob_files`, `grep_files`, `delete_file` |
| State (3) | `get_state`, `set_state`, `get_status` |
| Scripts (1) | `run_script` |
| Search (2) | `web_search`, `search_servers` |
| Orchestration (7) | `sleep_for`, `sleep_until`, `spawn_task`, `cancel_task`, `list_tasks`, `wait_for_event`, `emit_event` |
| MCP (dynamic) | `mcp_<server>_<tool>` — discovered at startup from `servers/*.json` configs |

## Testing

Tests use vitest. Run everything with `pnpm test` (unit + integration, ~4s). Integration tests use Testcontainers to spin up real Postgres.

Three layers: unit tests (mocked, fast), contract tests (FakeAnthropic validates Anthropic API message contracts), integration tests (real Postgres + real Absurd worker). Test infrastructure lives in `src/test/` — `fake-anthropic.ts`, `scenarios.ts`, `harness.ts`. History ↔ API message conversion is tested in `src/memory/messages.test.ts`.

## Gotchas

- **No build step**: Do not look for or try to create a `dist/` directory. The app runs TypeScript directly.
- **`.ts` imports in TypeScript**: All import paths use `.ts` extensions (e.g., `import { loadConfig } from "./config.ts"`). This works natively with Node 22.18+ type stripping — no `--experimental-strip-types` flag needed.
- **Suspending tools vs `ctx.step()`**: `sleep_for`, `sleep_until`, and `wait_for_event` throw `SuspendTask` and must NOT be wrapped in `ctx.step()`. Other tool calls should be wrapped in `ctx.step()` for checkpointing.
- **SQL injection surface**: `list_tasks` in `agent/tools/orchestration.ts` interpolates `queueName` directly into SQL. This is safe because `loadConfig` validates it as `/^[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*$/i` — do not bypass this validation.
- **Secret isolation**: Secrets are read from `.env` file, not `process.env`. Do not use `dotenv` or similar libraries that set `process.env`.
- **MCP reload timing**: Writing/deleting in `servers/` triggers `McpManager.reload()`, but the current task's tool registry is already frozen. New MCP tools are available starting with the next message/task.
- **`ALLOWED_CHAT_IDS` format**: Uses fully prefixed IDs (e.g. `telegram:601870898`, not bare `601870898`). Discovery mode shows the correct format.
